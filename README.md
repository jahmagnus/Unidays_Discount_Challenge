Unidays Discount challenege
How to use: 
- Run code and you will be prompted with a set of options

- You choose the option you would like by the corresponding integer

- if selecting quit, the program will close

- Selecting add item to basket will take you to another menu where you will be able
  select the item you would like to add to basket - repeat until finished with items
  
- select the calculate total and this will calculate the total cost of the items within
  according to the pricing rules and also add delivery costs if required. 

Approaching this task I began coding the methods in the unidays class right away and trying
to implemenet them in the main method. However, this was the wrong approach as I created 
confusement between what I wanted each method to do. I put the pricing rules in the wrong place
and the code was just not working the way I wanted. 

I decided to start over again. This time before I even started coding I wrote down the specifications
and broke each method down into smaller parts and made sure I knew beforehand what how I wanted
them to function. I wrote out some pseudocode on a piece of paper which included how I wanted to 
structure the class and the main method/static methods. I also decided to write down how I 
wanted to implement the pricing rules and the math behind each of them, although quite simple
math it was challenging for me to implement as I've haven't done this before in my
short time learning how to code. 

I coded to the structure I had written and was quite happy with the progress. Once I thought
I had finished I used the test cases to prove the accuracy of the discounter, but I found that 
many of the test cases showed different results because I hadn't got the maths correct. After
spending a couple of hours fixing the issues I tested it again and this time the test cases were
outputting the results I was hoping for. 

I know this code isn't elegant and probably doesn't impress, but it's the first project I have
completed and has helped me learn and also motivated me even more to pursue a developer job
in the future.
